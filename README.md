# AgentSmithResearch

This repository contains the results of my research for the Agent Smith project.

The goal of this research was to show whether the Moleculer Framework can actually be used for the improvement of the Agent Smith Simulator produced by TNO.

It is recommended to read the results document before consulting this repository.

Versions / Branches:
* Main - Contains the concept implementation which was mentioned in the results document.
* 1 - Single-threaded Game of Life.
* 2 - Game of Life using the Moleculer Microservices Framework.
* 3 - Version 2 but with slight adjustments so that we can check the execution times.
* 4 - Version 1 but with slight adjustments so that we can check the execution times.
